Yo what's up guys.

This is our Open Source Discord Bot made in Disord.py
We used python 3.6 and we used Discord.py version 1.0.1 rewrite.

I made this tutorial because I got very frustrated that I couldn't find any good Youtube videos that worked with these versions and so I have taken this into my hands so that I can help you young/old developers succeed.
