Yo what's up guys.

This is our Open Source Discord Bot made in Disord.py
We used python 3.6 and we used Discord.py version 1.0.1 rewrite.

We made this tutorial because we got very frustrated that we couldn't find any good Youtube videos that worked with these versions and so we have taken this into our hands so that we can help you young/old developers succeed.
